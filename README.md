## About

Swing is a cross platform competitive video game created in the last 6 hours of the hackathon featuring an iPhone 6 attached to a selfie stick. Users would be scored based on the yaw, roll, and pitch of their swing. This score would be kept in an online leaderboard. The user would be notified via email if they were elimated from the top 3 via email to encourage competitiveness.

## Functionality
